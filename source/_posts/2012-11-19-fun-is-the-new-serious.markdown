## New is fun

To set up this new blog, I decided to go with [Octopress](http://octopress.org).
Obviously, it has come with a bunch of caveats (mostly issue [#336](https://github.com/imathis/octopress/issues/336)),
but overall it has been a great experience.
There's been a tremendous amount of work achieved for Jekyll and for Octopress, and that deserves congratulations.
So __Congrats, guys__!

Although the tool is excellent, the best part of the process was _I've had fun_ doing it.
